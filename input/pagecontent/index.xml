    This is a solution FHIR Implementation Guide (IG) to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MYZHukPqMvZMSbtwm8SRcHnl7ee9bvC6NtZTwFQd45I" target="_blank">hackathon concept note</a>.
  </p>

  <p>
    The purpose of the hackathon was to simulate a data exchange between an EMR and laboratory system through a planned practical demonstration. 
    The overall intent of the planned practical was to allow participants to demonstrate what they have learnt through the creation of a FHIR IG where the use cases and data elements were provided by the lecturer. 
    <br />
    <br />
    Participants were required to deploy their FHIR IG to a lecturer provided <a href="https://jembi.gitbook.io/jembi-platform/" target="_blank">centrally hosted platform</a> per country and then demonstrate that their FHIR IG was able to support the use cases through a data exchange.

  <p>
    While this implementation guide and the underlying FHIR are licensed as public domain, this guide may include examples making use of terminologies such 
    as LOINC, SNOMED CT and others which have more restrictive licensing requirements. Implementers should make themselves familiar with licensing and 
    any other constraints of terminologies, questionnaires, and other components used as part of their implementation process. In some cases, 
    licensing requirements may limit the systems that data captured using certain questionnaires may be shared with.
